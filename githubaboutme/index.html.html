        <h2>My Experience in Web Design:</h2>
            <p>
            I know enough about web design to break things and make something akin to a website in 1994. I am currently enrolled in Web-140 Web Development tools and I would like to learn how to use these tools to make web design and my life a bit easier.

        <h3>Going forward in Web Development.</h3>
            <p>
            I have a vague idea that being a remote freelance Web Developer would be a rewarding and interesting career. Some of this craft does seem to be getting automated however I think that is going to be some time before it causes any serious detriment to people that practice this craft. So yeah working from my home office helping people improve the designs of their websites sounds like a fantastic way to go.
